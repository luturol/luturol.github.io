Hi, I'm Rafael Ahrons and this is my personal blog.

I like to write about my programming journey so others don't have to struggle with the subjects as I did. I'm trying to learn more about game dev, so I may be writing a lot of posts about Unity.

I'm currently trying to build some games with Unity to have fun and study, because I like a lot of gamming and I'm passionate of coding them. Always found more interesting to learn programming with games.

If you want to comment about a post of mine, you can send me an e-mail or comment them in [dev.to profile](https://dev.to/luturol).

Fell free to share with your thoughts.

Peace.
Don't forget to drink water and eat clean.

Good reading,

From Rafael Ahrons.
