# How to use Unity New Input System

This is more a tutorial to know how to configure and use in your code the new input system from Unity.

You can still use the old version of input system like 

```csharp
Input.GetAxisRaw("Vertical");

/*
 more code
/*

```
In this new version it's more easy to change between devices and configurations in runtime.
