## Finally released my first game

It's finished? No, it is not. It is cool? You good damn right (at least I enjoyed making and playing the microgame).

### What happend

The game jam was tough. I've learned a lot and got passionate with game dev. It's my first game that I made by myself. The result of the game jam isn't that good, but I'm proud of it.

In the middle of the jam I got sick and couldn't code till I get bether, so for some days I didn't code at all :(

The final days was insane. I've code a lot and try to fix some bugs, but in programming code = new bugs.

First, let's get to the results. You can play [Survive the night on itch](https://luturol.itch.io/survive-the-night).

What the game has:
 - A player with animations for: running, idle and attack.
 - A monster (Treant) with animations for: running, iddle and death.
 - Pathfinder for the Treant can find and run to the Player
 - Health bar for the Treant.

The game is simple for now. If you kill the treant, the game ends.

I got so happy with the results that even when it's finished I started coding to improve the game.

### The next features that I want is:

 - Spawn for Enemies
 - Adjust the ground layout. Because it doesn't fit the collor pallet and doesn't look natural.
 - Add a combat system for the Treants
 - Maybe add more creatures, but this would be made by me
 - Add a bonfire
 - Add light to the bonfire
 - Logo for the Survive the night
 - End screen when you win or loose.
 - Intial start game screen with the main character and the bonfire just vibing

This the features that I want to add for the next release.


Don't forget to eat clean and drink water.

Peace!!
